This post will mainly be about my YouTube video where I go over shell texturing.

(Video link will go here)

I will also write a YouTube script here, even though it's probably a good idea to just keep the script private, I don't really care,
so I will make it public.

## Part 0 - Disclaimer
In this video I will probably make some mistakes since I'm learning a new topic, feel free to correct me in the comments about anything I say wrong.

This video's main objective is to not showcase shell texturing but to go over what I did & learned in the #acerolafurrychallenge held by Acerola. This video will contain some math & shader terms that I might not explain from the ground up so I apologize in advance if something didn't make sense (insert Acerola video & advise to watch it before watching my video), im trying my best to keep this video short.

I also want to emphasize that I tried doing this challenge to the best of my ability by just learning from the video instead of straight jumping into Acerola's source code & copying code, I tried to do everything at the start by myself & only when I got stuck/finished the whole project I checked his code (it's similar anyway since I based mine off his video explanation).

Before I begin on what I did, I will try quickly explaining shell texturing.

## Part 0.5 - What is Shell Texturing?
Simply put it's an optimized technique for rendering certain types of geometries that might be difficult to render due to them requiring high amounts of polygons/triangles where instead of using "real" geometry you fake the effect with shells (or meshes). 

For example, 100 blades of grass or hair with real geometry, will require triangles for every single "strand", the issue with this is that let's say each "strand" will contain 10 triangles and that 10 triangles spanned throughout having a 100 blades (100 * 10 = 1000 tris already, 100 blades is nothing btw) can be exponentially expensive.

However, since computers are turbo-fast nowadays there are ways to get good real physics & graphics when it comes to hair, fur, & grass, etc. But, discussing that is out of the scope of this video.

#### How does Shell Texturing solve this issue?
Shell texturing uses a technique where we duplicate the base mesh of an object on top of each other while killing certain pixels on the mesh to give off a shape of exactly what we want. For example, grass & fur/hair can all be done using this method, as you can see in these pictures.

Since we duplicate the base mesh we don't create many triangles (assuming you are doing it right) & this method won't require tons of triangles like a geometry grass shader for example. However, this method is still prone to optimization issues such as overdraw, just go watch Acerola's video where he covers it.

## Part 1 - Managing The Shell Textures
First, a C# script to manage the shell textures (I CALLED THEM "SHEETS" IN MY CASE!). This ShellTextureManager script needs to manage all of the following functions & it's good to keep in mind this data is being sent to the GPU/Shell Texture Shader.

*Initial Parameters*
- Height (Manage height & spreading the sheets across the height)
- Density (density of the sheets / the amount of layers)
- Color (Shell texture color)

*Post-Initial Phase Parameters*
- Thickness (Change the thickness of the blocky "grass" shape)
- RNG Control (Max & Min, a way to control the RNG but also gives a similar effect to thickness)

These are the parameters & functions we need to have in our shell manager to control the shell texture effect & play around with the values to find something nice. More importantly, now we will tackle each of the functions above & talk about how to do them, prepare yourself for some math.

### Height
Initially, I hard coded this to test with quads but soon enough I realized I shouldn't continue with this approach since if I change the mesh it will just look like spheres stacked on top of each other with the same scale & etc. That's not what we want, we need to protrude the mesh along its normal to this we simply do the following.

V vector = for every vertex on the object  
N vector = for every vertex normal  
D scalar = distance/height  (SCALAR OFFSET)  
i decimal = normalized shell texture index  (ACEROLA CALLES THIS THE HEIGHT BUT IM CALLING IT THE "NORMALIZED INDEX")  

$$\vec{V} = \vec{N} \times {D} \times i$$

***VERY IMPORTANT! THESE MATH FORMULAS SHOWN ARE NOT TO BE SCALED 1:1 IN CODE, IT IS SHOWING THE FORMULA IN A SIMPLE MATTER. IN ACTUAL CODE YOU HAVE TO ADD THIS VECTOR OFFSET, THIS RULE WILL CONTINUE FOR THIS WHOLE POST/VIDEO.**

Notes: none.

### Density

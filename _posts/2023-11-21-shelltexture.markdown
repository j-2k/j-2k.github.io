This post will mainly be about my YouTube video where I go over shell texturing.

(Video link will go here)

I will also write a YouTube script here, even though it's probably a good idea to just keep the script private, I don't really care, so I will make it public.  

Since I want to begin learning some math notation for the future when reading about math when it comes up in shaders/blogs/articles I will include some math notation in this video so I can get some practice in.  

[latex.codecogs.com - Latex Editor #1](https://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/editor.php) OR [latexeditor.lagrida.com - Latex Editor #2](https://latexeditor.lagrida.com). I will also use these latex editors which I found online, which even have downloads which is awesome, just wanted to share this before I start :) (Suggest #2 for writing and #1 for downloads)

## Part 0 - Disclaimer
In this video I will probably make some mistakes since I'm learning a new topic, feel free to correct me in the comments about anything I say wrong.

This video's main objective is to not showcase shell texturing but to go over what I did & learned in the #acerolafurrychallenge held by Acerola. This video will contain some math & shader terms that I might not explain from the ground up so I apologize in advance if something didn't make sense (insert Acerola video & advise to watch it before watching my video), im trying my best to keep this video short.

I also want to emphasize that I tried doing this challenge to the best of my ability by just learning from the video instead of straight jumping into Acerola's source code & copying code, I tried to do everything at the start by myself & only when I got stuck/finished the whole project I checked his code (it's similar anyway since I based mine off his video explanation).

Before I begin on what I did, I will try quickly explaining shell texturing.

## Part 0.5 - What is Shell Texturing?
Simply put it's an optimized technique for rendering certain types of geometries that might be difficult to render due to them requiring high amounts of polygons/triangles where instead of using "real" geometry you fake the effect with shells (or meshes). 

For example, 100 blades of grass or hair with real geometry, will require triangles for every single "strand", the issue with this is that let's say each "strand" will contain 10 triangles and that 10 triangles spanned throughout having a 100 blades (100 * 10 = 1000 tris already, 100 blades is nothing btw) can be potentially expensive, on top of all the physics calculations in the vertex shader & etc.

However, since computers are turbo-fast nowadays there are ways to get good real physics & graphics when it comes to hair, fur, & grass, etc. But, discussing that is out of the scope of this video.

#### How does Shell Texturing solve this issue?
Shell texturing uses a technique where we duplicate the base mesh of an object on top of each other while killing certain pixels on the mesh to give off a shape of exactly what we want. For example, grass & fur/hair can all be done using this method, as you can see in these pictures.

Since we duplicate the base mesh a couple of times (show examples of this on-screen from #acerolafurrychallenge) to create an effect we want like fur, we don't create many triangles (assuming you are doing it right) like a geometry grass shader for example. However, this method is still prone to optimization issues such as overdraw, if you'd like to learn about overdraw just go watch Acerola's video where he covers it.

## Part 1 - Managing The Shell Textures
First, a C# script to manage the shell textures (I CALLED THEM "SHEETS" IN MY CASE!). This ShellTextureManager script needs to manage all of the following functions & it's good to keep in mind this data is being sent to the GPU/Shell Texture Shader.

*Initial Parameters*
- Height (Manage height & spread the sheets across the height)
- Density (density of the sheets / the amount of layers)
- Color (Shell texture color)

*Post-Initial Phase Parameters*
- Thickness (Change the thickness of the blocky "grass" shape)
- RNG Control (Max & Min, a way to control the RNG but also gives a similar effect to thickness)

These are the parameters & functions we need to have in our shell manager to control the shell texture effect & play around with the values to find something nice. More importantly, now we will tackle each of the functions above & talk about how to do them, prepare yourself for some math.

### Height
Initially, I hard coded this to test with quads but soon enough I realized I shouldn't continue with this approach since if I change the mesh it will just look like spheres stacked on top of each other with the same scale & etc. That's not what we want, we need to protrude the mesh along its normal to this we simply do the following.

V vector = for every vertex on the object  
N vector = for every vertex normal  
D scalar = distance/height  (SCALAR OFFSET)  
i decimal = normalized shell texture index  (ACEROLA CALLES THIS THE HEIGHT BUT IM CALLING IT THE "NORMALIZED INDEX")  

$${\color{white} \vec{V} = \vec{N} \times {D} \times i }$$

***VERY IMPORTANT! THESE MATH FORMULAS SHOWN ARE NOT ALWAYS TO BE SCALED 1:1 IN CODE, IT IS SHOWING THE FORMULA IN A SIMPLE MATTER. IN ACTUAL CODE YOU HAVE TO ADD THIS VECTOR OFFSET, THIS RULE WILL CONTINUE FOR THIS WHOLE POST/VIDEO.***

### Density
Since the Script manages the density this part is simple, in my case I have an array that stores all the shells & if I change the number of layers I have it just adjusts from the upper bound of the array, example if I want more shells I add, else if I need less I delete. These both start from the upper bound of the array in both cases. After adjusting the density you need to run the height function to fix all the new changes. Moving on to Part 2!  

$${\color{white}\forall i \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}, \: h = \frac{i}{n - 1}}$$

Explanation: for all elements i in the set from 1 to n (n being our max density number or # of LAYERS) the value of height or sheet index normalized is equal to i divided by n - 1. This math notation might be a bit confusing but again as I said previously I am trying to learn math notation, so just for the sake of simplicity I will show the code version which looks much simpler.

{% highlight c# %}
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
{   //casting to a float since keeping it an int will give you messed up results.
    _SheetIndexNormalized = (i / (float)(n - 1)); //this returned value ranges from 0 to 1!
    //_SheetIndexNormalized can also be interpreted as height or h
}   //this is just my garbage naming convention that I used which helped me understand more
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, when you have the height calculated you just send this height to the shader & set the value in the shader to be equal to this height. Acerola did this in the shader since I guess it's faster but I didn't know that, but it's okay since it doesn't matter too much right now since we are just trying to understand stuff.

Notes: none.

## Part 2 - UV & Noise
Let's talk about randomness, since we want to create grass, grass heights are often random in the real world, so to replicate a similar setting we first need a RNG for this shader, how do we do this? NOISE. we can do this by just stealing a hashing function from Shadertoy, but in all seriousness, we just need a decently uniform RNG, which a hashing function can do pretty well.  

I'm in no way a cryptographic/randomness specialized guy, but I have used hashing functions many times, however I don't exactly understand what happens inside them, all I know is that in a hashing function, we just insert a seed & that seed will be moved & some do bit shifting in the function so that a random number will come out of it ranging from 0 - 1, kinda all you need to know, not important to understand what happens inside that much.  

{% highlight c++ %}
float hash11(float p)       //hash11 I stole from shadertoy (1 input scalar 1 output scalar)
            {               //p gets inserted as our seed
                p = frac(p * .1031);
                p *= p + 33.33;
                p *= p + p;
                return frac(p);
            }
{% endhighlight %}

Since we now have a black & white shell we need to address why it's all just 1 color, that's because its starting size is from 0 - 1 we need to resize this UV map to be larger, and to do that we just multiply the size by 100, now we have a size UV of 100x100 "blocks" that are random greyscaled colors ranging from 0 - 1.

$${\color{white} \vec{UV^{\prime}} = \vec{UV} \times S }$$

Here I came across another problem where instead of using an uint, I used a float since I never weirdly used an int type in shaders I had a spam of noise on my quad because it's all in decimals so I never got the blocky/floor clamped numbers you would get using an uint instead of float. I was stuck on this even though I knew the issue was it being decimals while trying to understand why my noise value wasn't magically floored. Insert typical programmer brain fart moment.  

---

## Part 3 - Blocky Grass & Fake Ambient Occulusion
Now we have randomness which means we can start to simulate grass, our way of doing this is to simply compare 2 values, the random value and the height value of the shell (both range from 0 - 1).

if the random value is greater than the height value then we display the color of the shell, & if it's not we just discard it, quick detour, but I never knew a discard keyword existed, thought I had to use the clip function initially but discard in this case just works perfectly.

So now we have blocky grass however it's all very green and is very boring in color, to give it some depth & make it look nice we need to add some fake ambient occlusion (real AO calculation is something I don't understand yet & is fairly complex, insert wiki AO formula). In our case though thinking about it logically base of the grass would be darker since less sun will be able to reach the floor, and since we know our grass heights we just multiply the color by the normalized index value of the shell which is essentially the height.

$${\color{white}AO \hspace{0.25cm} Colors  = Grass\hspace{0.25cm}Color \times height}$$

With this done we can now see the grass base starting with being very dark to going up to a full green color. Now the color of the grass is based on its height.

---

## Part 4 - Thickness
To achieve sharp grass we need a way to shave off the blocks starting from the center to the outer section of the block, we can do this with a length function, however before that, we have not addressed our UVs not being properly corrected in local space.  
Things will start to get a little confusing so please bear with me & excuse my garbage explanation.

***UV PRIME IS THE UV RESIZED TO 100x100 (0 to 100) & NOT THE DEFAULT 1x1 (0 to 1). Previously in Part 2 I resized the UV & explained it there.***

$${\color{white} Local \hspace{0.25cm} Space = frac(\vec{UV^{\prime}}) }$$

This will give us a repeating set of UVs on our plane, however, it's not centered thus not optimal to start using our method of making a circle AT the center of the block of grass to cut the grass. To move it we simply do the following coordinate offset of the UV by adding a "* 2 - 1" to the fractional component.

$${\color{white} \vec{Centered \hspace{0.25cm} UV} =  frac(\vec{UV^{\prime}}) \times 2 - 1 }$$

Now we finally have centered UVs & it's time to get a circle so we can start cutting the grass based on the radius/length of the circle. By taking the distance of every pixel to our centered UVs we create a circle with the length function.

***Length function as per Nvidia CG Documentation uses dot product***  

$${\color{white} length = \sqrt{\vec{V}\cdot \vec{V}} }$$

***Simplified Version, squaring both xy components & adding them. Pythagorean theorem basically***  

$${\color{white} length = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} }$$

***Inserting the length function now***  

$${\color{white} Circles =  length(frac(\vec{UV^{\prime}}) \times 2 - 1)}$$

With this done we now have a tiny circle repeating itself 100 times on both the x & y axis. Now all we need to do is compare the strength of the color, to the scale of the thickness we set.

if the distance from the center (strength of the greyscale) is greater than the set thickness we just kill/discard the pixel. Doing so will give you cylindrical-shaped grass. Now when it comes to my implementation of clipping the cylinder to a cone shape it's worse since I used this with a clip function initially & am dividing & everyone knows dividing is big bad, so IMO you should stick to Acerola's thickness implementation which is comparing if the length is greater than the thickness times the (rng - the height).

{% highlight c++ %}
//Acerola thickness
//if the > statement is true return 1 else 0
int cone = length > thickness * (rng - height);
if(cone && _SheetIndex > 0) discard;
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c++ %}
//My garbage thickness - originally based off clip function to get it under 0 to kill pixels
//lenMask is also INVERSED PREVIOUSLY (THAT MEANS I DID (1 - Circles) before this line)
int cone = ((lenMask * (1 - _Thick )) - ((_SheetIndexNormalized/rng) - _Thick)) < 0;
if(cone && _SheetIndex > 0) discard;
{% endhighlight %}

Circles are obtained by doing the formula above, T is the thickness value YOU set & h is height & rng is the random value from the hash function.   

$${\color{yellow} 0 \leq h \leq 1}$$

$${\color{yellow} 0 \leq rng \leq 1}$$

$${\color{yellow} 0 \leq T \leq 1}$$

$${\color{white} Clip \hspace{0.25cm} Value = ((1 - Circles) \times (1 - T)) - ((\frac{h}{rng}) - T)}$$

The Clip Value above will dictate if the pixel should be displayed or not by the 2 lines below, where if clip goes under 0 it dies else it displays. Again, I originally made it this way because I was using the Clip Function.

$${\color{white} 
pixel = 
  \begin{cases} 
   {\color{Red}kill} & \text{if Clip Value < 0}\\
   {\color{green} display}& \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}}$$

My thickness is based on if the value goes under 0, so if it does then it will always discard the pixel unless the value is above 0 OR it's the first index (by first index I mean this "_SheetIndex > 0").

## Part 5 - Lighting
Lighting is fairly simple we are going to do the traditional Lambertian light model ***check wiki page*** where we reflection is calculated by taking the normal vector & the normalized light direction vector

*"The reflection is calculated by taking the dot product of the surface's unit normal vector N, and a normalized light-direction vector L, pointing from the surface to the light source. This number is then multiplied by the color of the surface and the intensity of the light hitting the surface:" - Lambertian Reflectance Wiki*

$${\color{white} Lambert \hspace{0.25cm} Light =  \vec{N} \cdot  \vec{L} }$$

*Very commonly the Light vector might be flipped in that case you just need to multiply the Light vector by -1, similarly done in my raytracer*

Now the only issue is with this lighting model the dark areas are extremely dark & get no light (0 ambient light), & it's currently unclamped which means the light ranges from -1 to 1 and negative light is weird so we clamp the light value to range from 0 to 1.
Though we still have the dark areas, to fix them we can just add value to upscale it in our case this technique is called a half lambert by Valve, it's where we multiply by 0.5 and add by 0.5, to lighten up the dark areas towards the midsection of the objects shading, this isn't physically based anymore for obvious reasons, but we shouldn't care since looks are more important than being technically correct as said by Acerola. 

$${\color{white} Half \hspace{0.25cm} Lambert =  \vec{N} \cdot  \vec{L} \times 0.5 + 0.5}$$

After this, Valve squares the Half Lambert value before multiplying it in the final color calculation to see the difference between the shaded & lit areas.

## Part 6 - Windy Grass & Grass Displacement

My wind implementation is not something worth talking about since it's really simple just a sine wave with a slight offset based on the height scaled with a strength value. A "good" wind implementation would probably use something like a noise map that features noise in a way that is shaped in black & white strips while the strips are slightly distorted in the direction they are moving in. Add the noise offset & see your results, moving on to the more important thing is Grass Displacement.  

Grass Displacement is currently based on a sphere shape since a sphere is the easiest shape to implement as it's just a number (as in the radius), we also need the position of the sphere for direction calculation. Once we have this we can do our full grass displacement calculations.   

$${\color{white}  \vec{V}  =  Vertex \hspace{0.25cm} Vector}$$

$${\color{white}  \vec{S}  =  Sphere \hspace{0.25cm} Vector}$$

$${\color{white}  \vec{Direction \hspace{0.25cm} Displacement}  =  \vec{V} - \vec{S}}$$

Displacement Direction from the origin of the sphere position pointing towards the vertex position, since the whole word of displacement direction is a little long I will substitute it with Vector SV to signify it's a vector going from S to V.  

$${\color{white} {Clamped \hspace{0.25cm} Displacement}  =  saturate(\frac{length(\vec{SV})}R)}$$

Once we have the clamped displacement scalar (THIS IS NOT A VECTOR ANYMORE, I KNOW IM SAYING DISPLACEMENT BUT I THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE THIS WAY) we now need to inverse it before we multiply it into the final normalized grass displacement vector to push them away. I will shorten "Clamped Displacement" to just CD in the next line.  

Before I continue I want to address that SV is now normalized in the final Grass Displacement Vector we do this since we need to compare the value from the inversed clamp displacement. A Normalized Vector has the hat above vector SV, & normalizing is calculated by dividing the vector by its magnitude/length.

$$\color{yellow} \hat{SV}=\frac{SV}{||SV||}$$

SV is normalized, in our case in code we just do normalize(SV), but I wanted to show it here since normalizing is important. I might make a post just about normalizing and how it's used everywhere.

$${\color{white}  \vec{Grass \hspace{0.25cm} Displacement}  =  \hat{\vec{SV}}  \times (1-CD)}$$

The full formula without reducing all of this garbage looks like this (this should work if you plug it into code).  

$${\color{magenta}  \vec{Grass \hspace{0.25cm} Displacement}  =  normalize(\vec{SV})  \times (1-saturate(\frac{length(\vec{V} - \vec{S})}R))}$$

# Script Stuff
You can skip all this garbage, this is the script for the YouTube video.

## Introduction
- Hello everybody, over the past week or 2 I participated in a challenge by Acerola where we had to implement a shader technique called Shell Texturing, so in today's video I will be discussing everything I did & everything I learned from participating in this challenge.  

- To make this video a little more fun I decided to follow Acerola's video style where I just talk into a mic except I'm using a crayon here, and show a bunch of garbage on the screen to help my explanation.  

- I also want to make clear that this video's main purpose is to explain MY challenges, & learning experiences, & NOT to explain everything about shell texturing, for that you should just watch Acerola's video which I recommend doing anyway before even watching this video (link in the description).   

## Disclaimer

Quick Disclaimer, I might make or explain some things incorrectly & if I do please correct me in the comment section, I also want to emphasize that when I initially did this challenge, I never jumped into the code directly rather I first tried to implement shell texturing from what I understood from just watching the video & only when I got stuck I looked at code. I also highly suggest people do this when they want to learn anything new, this technique helped me a lot when it comes to learning new things in general.  

One more disclaimer, I might not explain some shader terms or math terms I go over this video & apologize in advance if something didn't make sense. I will also be showing formulas in math notation which might make no sense since IMO it's hard to read & I hate math notation but it's something I have avoided for too long & need to learn for the sake of my future, I will try my best to show them while showing a simpler version of them through code or just explain it in plain English for the audience.  

## What is Shell Texturing

Shell texturing is a technique used in shaders to create a sense of depth and volume using just Shells & 2D Textures, this is commonly used in games to simulate surfaces that require complex geometries that require a lot of triangles such as fur, hair or grass, & even dense thin objects such as carpets, vines, or moss.    

This technique is mainly used when real-time rendering is important & optimization is crucial, with the visuals being slightly compromised it's still a very good trade-off in certain circumstances. It's also important to know that even though this technique is fairly old, it's still being used lately in popular games such as Genshin Impact.    

Shell texturing however does have some flaws in optimization such as overdraw, which happens if you have too many layers, (Watch Acerola explain overdraw because it's out of the scope of this video) so just be smart with what you do with it.   

## Managing Shells

The first step for me was to manage all the shell textures, since I didn't want to jump to shader code immediately, I wanted to first have functionality such as layer amount & height done, so I did that, however, I came across my first dumb mistake related to forgetting about normals.  

Before I talk about that let's talk about how I handle layers, all I have is an array that holds all the layers & when I change the amount of layers I want, it changes to the new set amount of layers by adding or removing layers from the upper bound of the array.  

Now when you do this the next problem comes where you won't have the shells matching to the height you set, so you need to always run a height function at the end to correctly set the heights of all the shells. Getting back to my first dumb mistake, Instead of setting the offset of my shells by the normals I just added an upward vector offset which is wrong, I didn't care since I was using quads but I knew an issue would come if I used spheres, so I quickly fixed this to include normals.  

Now you might ask what are normals? normals are vectors perpendicular to vertices of a 3D Model or Shells in this case. They are mainly used for shading & lighting calculation which we will come to later in this video.  

So how do we set the height of each shell to be based on the normals? Simple just offset the shell vertices by the normal vectors & multiply it by your max height/distance value & the shell index normalized value.   

$${\color{white} \vec{V} = \vec{N} \times {D} \times i }$$

What is the shell index normalized value? This is a garbage naming convention I used that helped me understand height distribution when it comes to my shells, it's a value that ranges from 0 to 1 obtained by doing the following shown in math notation, code, & english.   

$${\color{white}\forall i \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}, \: h = \frac{i}{n - 1}}$$  

{% highlight c# %}
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
{   //casting to a float since keeping it an int will give you messed up results.
    _SheetIndexNormalized = (i / (float)(n - 1)); //this returned value ranges from 0 to 1!
    //_SheetIndexNormalized can also be interpreted as height or h
}   //this is just my garbage naming convention that I used which helped me understand more
{% endhighlight %}  

***Simply put, the Index based Height which ranges from 0 to 1, is obtained by taking the index of a shell & dividing it by the total amount of shells***   

Highlighting again, that the sole purpose of this script is to send some values to our shader (GPU) with the biggest important 2 being height & density (amount of layers), small note instead of saying "height" I might say "Shell Index Normalized" which can be interpreted as height I just used this garbage naming convention because it ranges from 0 to 1 & it personally helped me understand it much more.  

## UV & Randomness

Since my objective was grass, we need to understand what grass is, & unfortunately I don't know what it is since I don't touch grass too often. *cut*   

So imagine yourself sitting outside of a Subway eating a steak & cheese sandwich since it's the only good option on the menu, & then looking outside at a patch of grass, the first thing to note is that grass has random heights & varying densities, thicknesses & etc.   

Here we will be addressing height & ignoring everything else because we are dumb, so how do we achieve random height? Noise, how do we get noise? by stealing a noise or hashing function from Shadertoy, you can trust me on this part since I do it often & Inigo Quilez is a pretty reliable guy, Source? Trust me bro.   

Now I don't understand exactly what happens in hashing functions but what I can tell you is that whatever you put in a hashing function gets moved around and sometimes bitshifted to give you a random value.   

The sole purpose of this hashing function is that it takes a seed and outputs a random value that is in the range of 0 to 1, we need to also make sure though that its values look distributed equally, so what does that mean?   

***Make funny drop table***   

Now I'm not a statistics guy, but if a monster A drop table contains say 3 items each being Asmongolds Hair, Acerolas Mic, or 500 dollars then if the drop table says Asmongolds Hair has a 99% drop chance, we can say monster A's drop table is NOT uniformly distributed.  

However, if all 3 items had the same drop chance that adds up to 100%, in this case, each item would have a 33.3% drop chance, now we have a uniform distribution in our drop table.

Now we addressed Randomness our shader might just display a single color, here I came across another issue where I never in my life in a shader used an unsigned integer datatype so I didn't get why my values were not magically floored until I realized I had a float since I normally never use anything besides a float, literally was stuck for 2 hours & experienced a programmer brain fart moment.

After fixing, we should see just a singular color across our UV that's because our UV ranges from 0 to 1 and integers in general, floors all decimals. To fix this we simply expand our UV map to range to a higher number such as 100, & is as simple as doing this (UV * 100), 100 being the new desired UV size.

With this done we should see noise on each shell texture, & be ready to move on to coloring & shaping.

## Blocky Grass & Fake Ambient Occulusion
To get the shape of grass, the noise or rng value holds a lot of info since it ranges from 0 to 1 and our height (shell index height) also ranges from 0 to 1 we can simply compare the 2 and see if the value of the 
height is less than the random value then simply output a color, else if the height exceeds the random value of that pixel just kill it in this case using the discard keyword.  

I never knew a discard keyword like this existed so I never used it, and have only been using clip to kill pixels, as you will see again coming up in the next section. I also want to ask a question to the 2 people watching this video, shouldn't you use never use conditions in shaders? I thought they were really bad & was told to never do them, this is probably why I never knew of the discard keyword, but anyway, not sure if this is true since I remember a long time ago looking up using conditions in shaders, it said something about it being "fine", but if you know a good answer please write it in the comments.

So now we finally have grass, but the only issue is that it looks like it lacks depth & is very flat-shaded, to fix this issue we simply multiply the color output by the height (shell index height). This should give you a nice Faked Ambient Occlusion effect within your grass, this is not how real AO works, but is a good approach to solving this issue.  

You know sometimes we don't care about being technically correct we should just do whatever looks right.

## Grass Thickness
This section is going to be garbage & I apologize in advance if it's garbage. Here I did my implementation on thickness but the process of killing pixels is based on clip and not discard since I didn't know it existed but I changed it anyway to feature discard when I learned about it.

So how should you do thickness? let's first say you should stick to Acerola's thickness which is a simple check of doing the following: if length is > thickness * (rng - height) then discard the pixel.

Now what horrid garbage did I do? Remember I said I used clip? here is what I got, I compared this whole line to see if it's less than 0, & if it is it dies, why less than 0? Because the clip function kills any pixel if the value fed to it goes under 0. *cut*

I'm going to go crazy I just opened the clip function on Nvidia CG docs & noticed that the clip function literally is an if statement that checks if x is less than 0 and if it's true then discards it; I'm going to explode *degen sounds*

## Windy Grass & Grass Displacement

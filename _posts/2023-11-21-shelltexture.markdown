This post will mainly just be for them main purpose of a gateway to my youtube video where I go over shell texturing.

(Video link will go here)

I will also write a youtube script here, even though it's probably a good idea to just keep the script private, i dont really care,
so I will make it public.

## Part 1 - Managing The Shell Textures
First a C# script to manage the shell textures (I CALLED THEM "SHEETS" IN MY CASE!). This ShellTextureManager script needs to manage all of the following functions & it's good to keep in mind this data is being sent to the GPU/Shell Texture Shader.

*Initial Parameters*
- Height (Manage height & spreading the sheets across the height)
- Density (density of the sheets / the amount of layers)
- Color (Shell texture color)

*Post-Initial Phase Parameters*
- Thickness (Change the thickness of the blocky "grass" shape)
- RNG Control (Max & Min, a way to control the RNG but also gives similar effect to thickness)

These are the parameters & functions we need to have in our shell manager to control the shell texture effect & play around with the values to find something nice. More importantly now we will tackle each of the functions above & talk about how to do them, prepare yourself for some math.

### Height
Initially I hard coded this to test with quads but soon enough I realized I shouldnt continue with this approach since if I change the mesh it will just look like spheres stacked on top of each other with the same scale & etc. That's not what we want, we need to protude the mesh along its normal to this we simply do the following.

V vector = for every vertex on the object  
N vector = for every vertex normal  
D scalar = distance/height  (SCALAR OFFSET)
i decimal = normalized shell texture index  (ACEROLA CALLES THIS THE HEIGHT BUT IM CALLING IT THE "NORMALIZED INDEX")

$$\vec{V} = \vec{N} \times {D} \times i$$

***VERY IMPORTANT! THESE MATH FORMULAS SHOWN ARE NOT TO BE SCALED 1:1 IN CODE, IT IS SHOWING THE FORMULA IN A SIMPLE MATTER. IN ACTUAL CODE YOU HAVE TO ADD THIS VECTOR OFFSET, THIS RULE WILL CONTINUE FOR THIS WHOLE POST/VIDEO.**

Notes: none.

### Density

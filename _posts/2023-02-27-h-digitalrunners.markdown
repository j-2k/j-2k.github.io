This is a Hackathon project done for the UAE Hackathon held by TDRA (Telecommunications & digital government regulatory authority), I was in the team Digital Runners representing Dubai Digital Authority.

The project is about viewing property using metaverse, however I can't talk more about it since it's a secretive idea & my colleagues asked this idea to be kept private. But, all I can say about it here is that I was the main developer of the project working on the whole pipeline & did everything from using shaders & implementing everyones ideas into the project.

This is a Hackathon project done in 2 days during the UAE Hackathon held by TDRA (Telecommunications & digital government regulatory authority), I was in the team Digital Runners representing Dubai Digital Authority.

The project is about property investments using metaverse, however I can't talk too much about it since it's a relatively secretive project idea from the team of designers. But, all I can say about here is that I was the main developer of the project working on the whole pipeline & did everything from using shaders & implementing everyones ideas into the project.

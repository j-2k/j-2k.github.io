[Baa-Phomet!!! on Itch.io](https://flamencoman.itch.io/baa-phomet)

This project was also awarded best games project showcase of year 2020.

An Isometric action fast paced game where you have to fight off goat-spawns that are overrunning planet earth, while doing this, you jump in between pillars to survive and keep distance from the horde of goat-spawns.

In addition to surviving and shooting, you have to manage upgrading yourself and doing ‚Äúquests‚Äù, which are mini games within the game to proceed to the next wave/level.

Contributors are Alwin, Srikar, Kyle, Yousef, Zhao, & I. This project was mainly disbanded after the completion of the unit however was continuously maintained by Alwin later on. Check him out from the Itch link above.

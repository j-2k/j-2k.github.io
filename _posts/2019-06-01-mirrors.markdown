<strong>I solely placed this project in my website for personal reasons, this is my first ever game I have created in Unity & was very happy when I completed it at the time.</strong>

Mirrors is a adventure & puzzle game features the player with a ally that looks the same as himself the player and the ally need to get out of the dimension they have been placed in.

Funnily enough I used these 2 songs for the game Old RuneScape Soundtrack: Harmony & The X Files Theme Song. It's probably the feeling of the song harmony that makes you feel like a kid again when playing a game.

Everything about the code structure of this game is horrid since its my first game & was learning but if you really want to see it click that > [Mirrors on Github](https://github.com/j-2k/PRPG). Project was made in Unity 2018.4 LTS.

[James Wick is on Itch.io](https://flamencoman.itch.io/james-wick)

A short stealth game set in a fictional sci-fi universe.

You play as James Wick, a veteran spy, back in the game.

Along the way he must collect data because unlike another spy, he does not get the option to choose his mission.

This game was made for Boss Bunny Game Jam 2021 (Theme: Fast & Slow).

All contributors can be seen in the itch.io page.

This post will mainly just be for them main purpose of a gateway to my youtube video where I go over shell texturing.

I will also write a youtube script here, even though it's probably a good idea to just keep the script private, i dont really care,
so I will make it public.

Tools used to edit/make the video: Sony Vegas +

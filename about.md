<p>Hello, I am Juma currently 22 whilst writing this in March of 2023.
I graduated with a Bachelors in Games Programming in the middle of 2022
and as you can guess I am mainly a Game developer however I also have a
huge interest in graphics programming. I generally like to work in 
anything relating to 3D environments & sometimes back-end stuff.
Most of my work resides in Games, Metaverse, 3D Modelling, Editing, & doing Technical Art etc.</p>

<p>I dont like saying the standard "I am passionate about X" so I'm just going to say
I easily have over 10,000+ hours of time spent in computer games across my lifetime.
I loved games ever since I was a child, and the decision to work on games as a adult
is definitly what I enjoy doing the most, no regrets.</p>


<h2>Future Aspirations</h2>

<p>In the future I wish to specialize in graphics development as I discovered
it's the most fun I had programming in a while. I want to get better at any shading language
to write good shaders & work with atleast one graphics specification such as OpenGL, DirectX, & Vulkan.
My favourite companies / places I dream to work at would be any triple-A games company
such as Blizzard, Valve, & Riot. Nvidia also sounds like a fun place to work at but the requirements
are extreme to enter, but hey this is just my list :).</p>


<h2>My Planned Roadmap</h2>

<li>Write my first Raytracer</li>
<li>Learn OpenGL</li>
<li>Render a Mesh with lighting</li>
